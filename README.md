# To-Do App
A basic CRUD to-do app that nests tasks within tasks.  
This was part of the Javascript course on The Odin Project.

## Instructions
* Click on the "New" button to add new subtasks to the current task.
* Click on a subtask to go inside of it.
* Click on the parent task title above the task title to navigate backwards.
* Right-click on a subtask to get the duplicate & delete options.

## What I Learned
* How to use localStorage
* Got more practice with "separation of concerns" using classes.
* The bind() function.
